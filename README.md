# Fashion-MNIST
The Fashion MNIST dataset comprises 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion
products (tops, trousers, dresses, etc.). The data can be loaded straight from
Keras into a training set (60,000 images) and a testing set (10,000 images). 


Training different Neural Networks on this dataset. try different learning rates, optimisers, batch sizes and architectures
